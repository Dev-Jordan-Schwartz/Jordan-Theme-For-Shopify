# TODOs
* Redo the search bar, Searchbar looks gross when it stretches the width of the page
* Create Footer
* Create custom sections that look purdy (This goes hand in hand with the mobile responsiveness issues on the homepage.)
* Figure out the issue with the blog post images resolution being fuzzy (Already attempted to fix it by setting the image property to full size but no luck)
* Adjust the spacing of the carrot arrow on dropdown menus
* Figure out a location to add the login, my account, cart, register and search bar elements on mobile.
* Make the Site Title on mobile view an href so clicking the title redirects you to the homepage.
